#WeightCalculator
It works by adding results of elections and then the polls that companies had made for those elections.
Just change the numbers in election1_actual, election2_actual, election3_actual and then, the election_polls. If you add more elections and polls, don't forget to add initial weight for those companies(Just divide 1 by the number of election companies. If there's 4 companies then the initial weight for each company should be 0.25)


#ElectionResultsCalculator:
Take the "final weights:" from the weight calculator and use them in this script. Then add predictions that those companies made and the script will calculate the election results using weights.
